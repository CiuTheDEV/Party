# Project Party - Project Context

## What Is This

Polish browser-based party game portal for hangouts and friend gatherings.
Inspiration: Jackbox Party Pack, but browser-first, Polish-first, no installation.

Core product model:
- `hub` is the platform shell,
- each game is its own module in `packages/games/<game>`,
- shared menu and setup chrome live in shared layers,
- gameplay stays per game.

---

## Current Focus

> Phase 5 - custom auth (email/password, guest + account) - done

Secondary focus completed in this session block:
- architecture cleanup for game modules,
- shared setup framework,
- ownership cleanup for `charades`,
- runtime move from `apps/hub` into `packages/games/charades`,
- hub and shared UI cleanup,
- `codenames` scaffold + module registration,
- shared host-navigation framework rollout with `charades` as the reference consumer.

## MVP Phases

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | Monorepo (Turborepo) setup, CI/CD base, Cloudflare-ready structure | Done |
| 1 | Hub - landing page, game list, shared shell | Done |
| 2 | Game SDK - module contract and shared interfaces | Done |
| 3 | First game: Charades / Kalambury MVP | Done |
| 3.5 | Module architecture cleanup: shared setup + module ownership | Done |
| 3.6 | Second module scaffold + module registry hardening | Done |
| 4 | Real-time multiplayer / deploy (Partykit, rooms, Cloudflare) | Done |
| 5 | Custom auth (email/password, guest + account) | Done |
| 6 | Leaderboards and game history | TODO |
| 7 | Monetization stubs (Stripe-ready, not connected) | TODO |
| 8 | Launch | TODO |

## Architecture

```text
project-party/
|- apps/
|  `- hub/                  # Next.js platform shell
|- packages/
|  |- ui/                   # Shared shell, shared setup chrome, shared primitives
|  |- game-sdk/             # Module contract (config, status, setup, menu, results)
|  `- games/
|     |- charades/          # First live game module
|     `- codenames/         # Live game module (menu + setup + full runtime)
`- content/
   `- charades/             # Word lists and categories
```

### Current Architectural Direction

- `hub` owns platform concerns:
  - routing,
  - game registry,
  - shared shell mounting,
  - session/bootstrap glue.
- `@party/ui` owns shared presentation patterns:
  - topbar,
  - sidebar,
  - shell layout,
  - setup modal/template chrome,
  - shared platform modal primitives,
  - shared settings-screen primitives (`AlertDialog`, settings shell/footer/tabs/status/placeholder/header/hero),
  - shared host-navigation engine/provider and controlled focus surfaces.
- `@party/game-sdk` owns the module contract and host-navigation profile contract.
- each game module owns:
  - `config`,
  - `config.status` (`live` or `coming-soon`),
  - menu content,
  - setup sections,
  - setup validation/state model,
  - results UI,
  - gameplay entrypoints/runtime,
  - navigation profiles and delegated host-navigation commands for its own surfaces.

### Important Nuance

Current repo now matches the intended split much more closely:
- `apps/hub` is platform routing + registry + hub feature code,
- `@party/ui` owns shared shell/setup primitives,
- `charades` owns menu, setup, results, and runtime,
- `codenames` is live with full menu, setup, captain/host runtime, and ongoing validation/polish work.

### Shared Setup Model

The approved direction is:
- every game uses the same setup skeleton/chrome,
- each game injects its own setup sections,
- setup state is one shared object per game,
- gameplay after clicking `Start` stays fully custom.

This means:
- UI updates to setup shell propagate to all games,
- games keep flexibility in section content and order,
- hub does not hardcode per-game setup structure.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Structure | Monorepo (Turborepo) | Hub + independent game packages |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages + Workers | Free tier + aligned with owner account |
| Real-time | Partykit | Fastest path to multiplayer on CF stack |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 | Native CF, zero ops |
| Auth | Custom email/password auth | Same-origin Pages Functions + D1 keep the stack free-tier and future-proof |
| Payments | Stripe stub only | Monetization-ready, no live payments now |
| Shared setup | One shell, custom game sections | Common UX without losing game flexibility |
| Module rollout | Explicit `config.status` | Register future games before gameplay is ready |

## Open Questions / Remaining Tech Debt

- [ ] Finalize Phase 4 deploy path for hub + Partykit
- [ ] Deploy and test Codenames runtime end-to-end (PartyKit server + host + captain screens implemented)
- [ ] Decide whether Hub library cards should become fully data-driven from module registry
- [ ] Decide long-term room architecture details before production multiplayer
- [ ] Finish the live UX polish pass for Charades runtime host controls now that the shared host-navigation framework is in place

## Session Handoff
- Last: 2026-04-19 16:21 by Codex
- Task: Playwright clean reinstall, visible-browser e2e setup, and safe repo cleanup pass on top of the current Codenames runtime work.
- Did: Reinstalled Playwright from scratch, aligned browser binaries with the installed package version, added a headed/slow `test:e2e:live` flow, and verified both standard and visible-browser e2e runs. Cleaned obvious tracked local artifacts (`.partykit`, `.superpowers`, `.playwright-mcp`, stale logs/reports) plus generated `js/d.ts` files that had leaked into `packages/ui/src/host-navigation/`. Left `rules/`, `docs/`, `memory/`, agent/tooling folders, and root utilities in place because they are not yet proven dead.
- Next: Continue with manual runtime validation for Codenames/Charades and, if desired, run a separate deliberate cleanup pass for optional root tooling files and heavy assets.
- Note: `npm install` and `npx playwright install chromium` must not be parallelized in this repo; doing so can download a mismatched browser revision versus the final installed Playwright package.
- Blocker: None.
